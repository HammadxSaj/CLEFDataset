1000902583	G01.1_1000902583_1	Abstract   Novel technological advances in mobile devices and applications can be exploited in wildfire confrontation, enabling end-users to easily conduct several everyday tasks, such as access to data and information, sharing of intelligence and coordination of personnel and vehicles.
1000902583	G01.1_1000902583_2	This work describes an innovative mobile application for wildfire information management that operates on Windows Phone devices and acts as a complementary tool to the web-based version of the AEGIS platform for wildfire prevention and management.
1000902583	G01.1_1000902583_3	Several tasks can be accomplished from the AEGIS App, such as routing, spatial search for closest facilities and firefighting support infrastructures, access to weather data and visualization of fire management data (water sources, gas refill stations, evacuation sites etc.).
1000902583	G01.1_1000902583_4	An innovative feature of AEGIS App is the support of these tasks by a digital assistant for artificial intelligence named Cortana (developed by Microsoft for Windows Phone devices), that allows information utilization through voice commands.
1000902583	G01.1_1000902583_5	The application is to be used by firefighting personnel in Greece and is potentially expected to contribute towards a more sophisticated transferring of information and knowledge between wildfire confrontation operation centers and firefighting units in the field.
11	M1_11_1	Eight healthy physically active male subjects (age 21.4±4.8 yr, body mass (BM) 79.3±11.9 kg, peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) 48.1±4.8 mL·kg−1·min−1, leg extension one repetition maximum (1RM) 104±20 kg; values are mean ± SD) who had been participating in regular exercise (3 times wk−1 for >6 months) volunteered for this study.
13	M1_13_1	Resistance exercise consisted of eight sets of five repetitions at ∼80% of 1RM.
130055196	G01.1_130055196_1	As various kinds of output devices emerged, such as highresolution printers or a display of PDA(Personal Digital Assistant), the importance of high-quality resolution conversion has been increasing.
130055196	G01.1_130055196_2	This paper proposes a new method for enlarging image with high quality.
130055196	G01.1_130055196_3	One of the largest problems on image enlargement is the exaggeration of the jaggy edges.
130055196	G01.1_130055196_4	To remedy this problem, we propose a new interpolation method, which uses artificial neural network to determine the optimal values of interpolated pixels.
130055196	G01.1_130055196_5	The experimental results are shown and evaluated.
130055196	G01.1_130055196_6	The effectiveness of our methods is discussed by comparing with the conventional methods.
135571562	G01.1_135571562_1	Inappropriate use of medicines increases the risk of hospital admissions for the elderly.
135571562	G01.1_135571562_2	Not only does this lead to unnecessary suffering for the patients but also incurs a great financial cost to the society.
135571562	G01.1_135571562_3	A medicine decision support system in a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), with a barcode reader, can provide an overview of the patientsu0027 complete medicine use, and detect unsuitable drugs and drug combinations.
135571562	G01.1_135571562_4	Focusing on the elderly, our aim was to evaluate if a mobile medicine decision support system with a barcode reader is useful and user-friendly for nurses in home care.
135571562	G01.1_135571562_5	The participants received a comprehensive overview from the patientsu0027 medicine use and noted drug-drug interactions, therapeutic duplications and warnings for drugs unsuitable for elderly people.
135571562	G01.1_135571562_6	The nurses regarded that the decision support system increased prevention and safety, was useful and user-friendly.
135571562	G01.1_135571562_7	Our findings suggest that most of the content and functions were regarded as important.
135571562	G01.1_135571562_8	Therefore, this decision support system might be a useful tool for district nurses.
14	M1_14_1	After completion of the final set, subjects rested for 5 min before commencing 30 min of continuous cycling at ∼63% PPO (∼70% VO2peak).
1462481249	G01.1_1462481249_1	:[0],""access to patient appointment schedules can help clinicians manage time and problems better.
1462481249	G01.1_1462481249_2	Many large health care organizations manage clinical appointment scheduling via enterprise resource scheduling systems which are poorly accessible by clinicians.
1462481249	G01.1_1462481249_3	Also, staff other than the clinicianu0027s personal assistant(s) may manage scheduling, making it difficult for clinicians to stay informed of changes.
1462481249	G01.1_1462481249_4	Many a clinician today uses a personal digital assistant (PDA) containing basic calendaring functionality.
1462481249	G01.1_1462481249_5	Our “PalmOversite” project demonstrates the feasibility of integrating enterprise appointment schedule information into a PDA calendar, making schedule information much more readily available to the clinician.
1498424448	G01.1_1498424448_1	It is widely acknowledged that information such as web content should be adapted for mobile platforms to account for restrictions in mobile environments.
1498424448	G01.1_1498424448_2	As emerging mobile platforms such as different kinds of Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) tend to vary largely in their capabilities, we suggest that adaptation should be platform-specific.
1498424448	G01.1_1498424448_3	Common approaches for content adaptation are automated conversion and explicit specification of adapted content, with a trade-off between quality and development/maintenance effort.
1498424448	G01.1_1498424448_4	As alternative avoiding this trade-off, we propose a simple object-oriented framework for content adaptation.
1498424448	G01.1_1498424448_5	To facilitate the use of this framework in the Web, we base our approach on the object-oriented WebComposition model and its XML-based implementation WCML.
1498424448	G01.1_1498424448_6	We apply our object-oriented approach to an example application to demonstrate how object-oriented specification of platform-adapted content reduces development/maintenance effort.
1500538608	G01.1_1500538608_1	In recent years, we have developed applications for teaching both wired and wireless networking.
1500538608	G01.1_1500538608_2	These applications have been written for the Cybiko personal digital assistant, an inexpensive alternative to other hardware.
1500538608	G01.1_1500538608_3	Unfortunately, the Cybiko PDA was recently discontinued.
1500538608	G01.1_1500538608_4	As a result, these applications had to be ported to other platforms to remain useful.
1500538608	G01.1_1500538608_5	Instead of porting each application to individual platforms, which would prove to be extremely time consuming because of other APIu0027s and networking protocols, we created the Vassar College Messaging Layer.
1500538608	G01.1_1500538608_6	This layer abstracts the Cybiko networking structure and interface, allowing Cybiko applications to be ported to other platforms with minimal code alteration.
1512574235	G01.1_1512574235_1	Mobile agents are a competitive concept of client-server computing and are especially suitable in mobile environments, that are characterized by low bandwidth communication facilities and ad hoc connection/disconnection to stationary systems.
1512574235	G01.1_1512574235_2	They can be used for information retrieval and information filtering, in which case they evaluate replies and return only the relevant data.
1512574235	G01.1_1512574235_3	Mobile agents as a metaphor of active objects are created on a mobile device such as a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), will be launched into the information galaxy and are fulfilling the mobile user ‘s task on the services available on networked stationary systems.
1512574235	G01.1_1512574235_4	One transmission channel for these itinerant agents is email.
1512574235	G01.1_1512574235_5	This paper introduces Active M 3 as an example of an active mail framework, which can be regarded as a first approach in authoring mobile agents in a graphical interactive manner.
1512574235	G01.1_1512574235_6	Active M 3 integrates two known concepts: active mail and multimedia mail.
1522515958	G01.1_1522515958_1	Dr. Who is a Microsoft research project aiming at creating a speech-centric multimodal interaction framework, which serves as the foundation for the NET natural user interface.
1522515958	G01.1_1522515958_10	The paper discusses MiPadu0027s design, implementation work in progress, and preliminary user study in comparison to the existing pen-based PDA interface.
1522515958	G01.1_1522515958_2	MiPad is the application prototype that demonstrates compelling user advantages for wireless personal digital assistant (PDA) devices, MiPad fully integrates continuous speech recognition (CSR) and spoken language understanding (SLU) to enable users to accomplish many common tasks using a multimodal interface and wireless technologies.
1522515958	G01.1_1522515958_3	It tries to solve the problem of pecking with tiny styluses or typing on minuscule keyboards in todayu0027s PDAs.
1522515958	G01.1_1522515958_4	Unlike a cellular phone, MiPad avoids speech-only interaction.
1522515958	G01.1_1522515958_5	It incorporates a built-in microphone that activates whenever a field is selected.
1522515958	G01.1_1522515958_6	As a user taps the screen or uses a built in roller to navigate, the tapping action narrows the number of possible instructions for spoken word understanding.
1522515958	G01.1_1522515958_7	MiPad currently runs on a Windows CE Pocket PC with a Windows 2000 machine where speech recognition is performed.
1522515958	G01.1_1522515958_8	The Dr Who CSR engine uses a unified CFG and n-gram language model.
1522515958	G01.1_1522515958_9	The Dr Who SLU engine is based on a robust chart parser and a plan-based dialog manager.
153108038	G01.1_153108038_1	Nursing students can learn many things through practical training by experiencing actual medical practice and by coming in contact with patients.
153108038	G01.1_153108038_2	Therefore practical training is an effective learning opportunity for developing the practical nursing care ability of nursing students.
153108038	G01.1_153108038_3	Moreover, at hospitals, which are important training facilities, with regard to medical safety, the use of learning tools that produce electrical waves is not possible.
153108038	G01.1_153108038_4	So, we created a learning support environment that facilitates the imagination of nursing techniques, and enables effective preparation, review, and learning at anytime and anywhere using a portable digital assistant (PDA) device for practical training.
153108038	G01.1_153108038_5	As described in this paper, we report on the outline of the educational materials named ""digital nursing dictionary"" that we developed and the evaluation of the practices using it.
1531910924	G01.1_1531910924_1	Limitation in display size and resolution on mobile devices is one of the main obstacles for wide-spread use of web applications in a wireless environment.
1531910924	G01.1_1531910924_2	Web pages are often too large for a PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) screen to present.
1531910924	G01.1_1531910924_3	The same problem exists for devices with low resolution such as WebTV.
1531910924	G01.1_1531910924_4	Manual reconstruction of web pages for these devices would ease the problem; however, the large variation of display capabilities will greatly increase the burden of web page designers since they have to customize a web page for each possible display device.
1531910924	G01.1_1531910924_5	In this paper, we propose a document segmentation and presentation system.
1531910924	G01.1_1531910924_6	The system automatically divides a web document into a number of logical segments based on the screen size and the structure and content of the document.
1531910924	G01.1_1531910924_7	Additional information such as overviews and summaries is also extracted to facilitate navigation.
1531910924	G01.1_1531910924_8	The system presents the segments and structural information of a web document to make full use of the screen for information finding.
1542845548	G01.1_1542845548_1	This paper presents a method to generate unique and nevertheless highly random pseudonyms in a distributed environment.
1542845548	G01.1_1542845548_2	More precisely, each user can now generate his pseudonym locally in his personal security environment, e.g.
1542845548	G01.1_1542845548_3	in his smart card or his personal digital assistant.
1542845548	G01.1_1542845548_4	There is no need for any information interchange between issuing parties or global data (especially keys), except unique identifiers for each user and each device of the system.
1542845548	G01.1_1542845548_5	Additionally the holder can prove, that he generated a specific pseudonym without revealing his identity and he can reveal his identity by disclosing the pseudonym.
1542845548	G01.1_1542845548_6	Whereas the verifier of a disclosed pseudonym can be sure, that the presenter of the pseudonym is the holder of the pseudonym (i.e.
1542845548	G01.1_1542845548_7	the person which originally generated it).
1542845548	G01.1_1542845548_8	The identifier of the user and the identifier of the useru0027s device will be used to generate unique pseudonyms, but to ensure pseudonymity, both components will be stored in the pseudonym in encrypted form.

3	M1_3_1	Muscle contraction and the intake of leucine-rich protein sources activate independent but complimentary signaling responses that converge at the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) to stimulate protein translation enhancing rates of muscle protein synthesis [4]–[6].
31	M1_31_1	Given the need to promote protein synthesis that underpins adaptation, repair and regeneration of skeletal muscle the results of the current study provide clear evidence of impaired recovery when alcohol is consumed after concurrent (resistance, continuous and intermittent high-intensity) exercise even in the presence of optimal nutritional conditions.
32	M1_32_1	We propose our data is of paramount interest to athletes and coaches.
33	M1_33_1	Our findings provide an evidence-base for a message of moderation in alcohol intake to promote recovery after exercise with the potential to alter current sports culture and athlete practices.
34	M2_34_1	Physical activity has proved to be an effective means of preventing several diseases and improving general health.
34	M2_34_2	Common sense advices call for late inception of intense, strength training-related activities, like weight lifting and plyometrics, which are usually postponed at the end of the growth age, even among sport practitioners.
34	M2_34_3	However, such advices seem to have a mainly anecdotal nature.
34	M2_34_4	Current literature does not seem to have any particular aversion against the practice of strength training by children and adolescents, provided that some safety rules are followed, like medical clearance, proper instruction from a qualified professional and progressive overload.
34	M2_34_5	At the same time, several studies provide consistent findings supporting the benefits of repeated, intense physical efforts in young subjects.
34	M2_34_6	Improved motor skills and body composition, in terms of increased fat free mass, reduced fat mass and enhanced bone health, have been extensively documented, especially if sport practice began early, when the subjects were pubescent.
34	M2_34_7	It can be therefore concluded that strength training is a relatively safe and healthy practice for children and adolescents.
35	M3_35_1	recently, there has been a renewed public interest in IFast.
35	M3_35_2	Given the importance of nutrition in optimizing athletic performance, there is a concern about the effects of IFast on athletics.
35	M3_35_3	Looking at high-intensity, endurance, and resistance exercises, studies have been varied but are uniform in showing that there is no benefit to athletic performance while fasting.
37	M5_37_1	Nutrient timing is a popular nutritional strategy that involves the consumption of combinations of nutrients--primarily protein and carbohydrate--in and around an exercise session.
37	M5_37_2	Some have claimed that this approach can produce dramatic improvements in body composition.
37	M5_37_3	It has even been postulated that the timing of nutritional consumption may be more important than the absolute daily intake of nutrients.
37	M5_37_4	The post-exercise period is widely considered the most critical part of nutrient timing.
37	M5_37_5	Theoretically, consuming the proper ratio of nutrients during this time not only initiates the rebuilding of damaged muscle tissue and restoration of energy reserves, but it does so in a supercompensated fashion that enhances both body composition and exercise performance.
37	M5_37_6	Several researchers have made reference to an anabolic “window of opportunity” whereby a limited time exists after training to optimize training-related muscular adaptations.
37	M5_37_7	However, the importance - and even the existence - of a post-exercise ‘window’ can vary according to a number of factors.
37	M5_37_8	Not only is nutrient timing research open to question in terms of applicability, but recent evidence has directly challenged the classical view of the relevance of post-exercise nutritional intake with respect to anabolism.
38	M6_38_1	Lack of time is among the more commonly reported barriers for abstention from exercise programs.
38	M6_38_2	The aim of this review was to determine how strength training can be most effectively carried out in a time-efficient manner by critically evaluating research on acute training variables, advanced training techniques, and the need for warm-up and stretching.
38	M6_38_3	When programming strength training for optimum time-efficiency we recommend prioritizing bilateral, multi-joint exercises that include full dynamic movements (i.e. both eccentric and concentric muscle actions), and to perform a minimum of one leg pressing exercise (e.g. squats), one upper-body pulling exercise (e.g. pull-up) and one upper-body pushing exercise (e.g. bench press).
38	M6_38_4	Exercises can be performed with machines and/or free weights based on training goals, availability, and personal preferences.
38	M6_38_5	Weekly training volume is more important than training frequency and we recommend performing a minimum of 4 weekly sets per muscle group using a 6–15 RM loading range (15–40 repetitions can be used if training is performed to volitional failure).
38	M6_38_6	Advanced training techniques, such as supersets, drop sets and rest-pause training roughly halves training time compared to traditional training, while maintaining training volume.
38	M6_38_7	However, these methods are probably better at inducing hypertrophy than muscular strength, and more research is needed on longitudinal training effects.
38	M6_38_8	Finally, we advise restricting the warm-up to exercise-specific warm-ups, and only prioritize stretching if the goal of training is to increase flexibility.
47	M15_47_1	Resistance training is the most effective method to increase muscle mass.
47	M15_47_2	It has also been shown to promote many health benefits.
47	M15_47_3	Although it is deemed safe and of clinical relevance for treating and preventing a vast number of diseases, a time-efficient and minimal dose of exercise has been the focus of a great number of research studies.
47	M15_47_4	Similarly, an inverted U-shaped relationship between training dose/volume and physiological response has been hypothesized to exist.
47	M15_47_5	However, the majority of available evidence supports a clear dose-response relationship between resistance training volume and physiological responses, such as muscle hypertrophy and health outcomes.
47	M15_47_6	Additionally, there is a paucity of data to support the inverted U-shaped response.
47	M15_47_7	The overarching principle argued herein is that volume is the most easily modifiable variable that has the most evidenced-based response with important repercussions, be these muscle hypertrophy or health-related outcomes.
51	M19_51_1	Inactive adults experience a 3% to 8% loss of muscle mass per decade, accompanied by resting metabolic rate reduction and fat accumulation.
51	M19_51_2	Ten weeks of resistance training may increase lean weight by 1.4 kg, increase resting metabolic rate by 7%, and reduce fat weight by 1.8 kg.
51	M19_51_3	Benefits of resistance training include improved physical performance, movement control, walking speed, functional independence, cognitive abilities, and self-esteem.
51	M19_51_4	Resistance training may assist prevention and management of type 2 diabetes by decreasing visceral fat, reducing HbA1c, increasing the density of glucose transporter type 4, and improving insulin sensitivity.
51	M19_51_5	Resistance training may enhance cardiovascular health, by reducing resting blood pressure, decreasing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides, and increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.
51	M19_51_6	Resistance training may promote bone development, with studies showing 1% to 3% increase in bone mineral density.
51	M19_51_7	Resistance training may be effective for reducing low back pain and easing discomfort associated with arthritis and fibromyalgia and has been shown to reverse specific aging factors in skeletal muscle.
53	M21_53_1	Maximizing the hypertrophic response to resistance training (RT) is thought to be best achieved by proper manipulation of exercise program variables including exercise selection, exercise order, length of rest intervals, intensity of maximal load, and training volume.
53	M21_53_2	An often overlooked variable that also may impact muscle growth is repetition duration.
53	M21_53_3	Duration amounts to the sum total of the concentric, eccentric, and isometric components of a repetition, and is predicated on the tempo at which the repetition is performed.
53	M21_53_4	We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine whether alterations in repetition duration can amplify the hypertrophic response to RT.
53	M21_53_5	Results indicate that hypertrophic outcomes are similar when training with repetition durations ranging from 0.5 to 8 s.
53	M21_53_6	From a practical standpoint it would seem that a fairly wide range of repetition durations can be employed if the primary goal is to maximize muscle growth.
53	M21_53_7	Findings suggest that training at volitionally very slow durations (>10s per repetition) is inferior from a hypertrophy standpoint, although a lack of controlled studies on the topic makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions.
