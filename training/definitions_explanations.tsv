Descriptive decision theory contrasts with normative decision theory, which focuses on how people should make decisions according to principles of rationality.
Descriptive decision theory has identified a number of heuristics (mental shortcuts) and biases, such as: anchoring and adjustment, availability heuristic, confirmation bias, loss aversion.
These heuristics and biases can lead to suboptimal decisions, but they are also essential for efficient decision-making in complex and uncertain environments. Descriptive decision theory seeks to understand how these heuristics and biases interact and how they affect different types of decisions.
Descriptive decision theory has a wide range of applications, including Economics, Psychology, Healthcare, Engineering."	4

Resistance can come from various sources, such as free weights (dumbbells, barbells), weight machines, resistance bands, or even the body's own weight. The resistance provides the force that muscles need to work against, leading to the development of strength. There are different types of resistance training: isometric training, which involves static muscle contractions without joint movement (e.g., planks); isotonic training, which involves dynamic muscle contractions with joint movement. It can be further divided into concentric (muscle shortens) and eccentric (muscle lengthens) contractions; isokinetic training, which involves a consistent speed of movement throughout the range of motion."	20

The first one is a slow-paced controlled physical activity which involves putting the body part in a comfortable position that elongates the muscle without causing pain with low force for a prolonged duration of time (usually 30 seconds). In turn, static stretch is subdivided into: active-static stretching and passive static-stretching. Dynamic stretching is a controlled movement, unlike ballistic stretches that involve bouncing movements which increase the risk of injury, involving the performance of a movement progressively increasing the range of motion through successive repetitive motions till the end of the range is achieved. It can be done standing or while moving. Ultimately, pre-contraction stretching is a type of stretching that involves both the contraction and stretching of the muscle. It has been originally developed for the sole reason of relaxing muscles and increasing muscle tone.	20

M7_39_2	Meta-regression analysis	Meta-analysis is a quantitative, formal, epidemiological study design used to systematically assess previous research studies to derive conclusions about that body of research	This study design aims to address past studies and offer resolutions concerning their topics	16
M7_39_2	Systematic review	Systematic reviews, as the name implies, typically involve a detailed and comprehensive plan and search strategy derived a priori with the goal of reducing bias by identifying, appraising, and synthesizing all relevant studies on a particular topic	This kind of review aims to classify all past research on a determined topic, following a preselected strategy	16
M7_39_3	Volume-equated basis	A volume-equated basis concerns lifting training when based on weight value per repetitions	It refers to a lifting training basis which focuses on being volume-equated, that is the value of weight multiplied by lifting repetitions and number of sets	16
M7_39_4	Meta-regression analysis	Meta-analysis is a quantitative, formal, epidemiological study design used to systematically assess previous research studies to derive conclusions about that body of research	This study design aims to address past studies and offer resolutions concerning their topics	16
M7_39_4	Non-volume-equated studies	Studies on training aimed at assessing results without taking into account volume	It refers to studies which did not employ a volume-oriented approach, thus ignoring the role of volume in training sessions	16
M7_39_5	Muscle hypertrophy	Muscular hypertrophy or muscle  growth, refers to an increase in muscle mass	It refers to an increase in size and mass of muscle matter	16
M7_39_5	Resistance training frequency	The frequency variable can refer to the number of resistance training sessions performed in a given period of time, as well as to the number of times a specific muscle group is trained over a given period of time.	It refers to how many times a specific muscle type was trained over a specified amount of time	16
M7_39_6	Training volume	Volume is a measure of the total amount of activity or work performed	It refers to the total load of work	16
M8_40_2	hypertrophic response	Hypertrophic response is the physiological process by which muscle fibers increase in size.	This response is commonly associated with resistance training, such as weightlifting and other forms of strength training. Hypertrophy occurs when the rate of muscle protein synthesis exceeds the rate of muscle protein breakdown.	10
M8_40_3	muscle hypertrophy	Muscle hypertrophy is the increase in the size or cross-sectional area of muscle cells.	It is a physiological response to resistance training or other forms of muscular stress, leading to an enlargement of individual muscle cells. Muscle hypertrophy is frequently linked with strength training or resistance exercises, in which muscles undergo repetitive and increasingly demanding contractions. This sustained stimulus initiates a cascade of molecular and cellular responses, culminating in the eventual growth and adaptation of the muscle tissue over time.	10
M9_41_1	Lean body mass	lean body mass refers to those non-fat tissues, mainly muscle, bone and minerals, consisting of approximately 73% water, 20% protein and 7% minerals (electrolytes)	Lean mass is all body mass (muscles, bones, organs, blood, hair, etc.) free of fat (including essential fat). On the other hand, fat mass represents the amount of fat in the body, including essential fat. Essential fat represents in humans the part of the body fat necessary for the ordinary physiological functions of the body.	20
M9_41_3	Metabolic stress	metabolic stress is a physiological process that occurs during exercise in response to low energy that leads to metabolite accumulation [lactate, phosphate inorganic (Pi) and ions of hydrogen (H+)] in muscle cells	Metabolic stress is a physiological process that facilitates muscle growth. Metabolic stress occurs when we increase the workload on a muscle or a specific muscle group. Several components are stimulated which together increase muscle mass, such as fibre recruitment, hormone production, or cellular hydration status.	20
M9_41_4	Powerlifter	powerlifter practices weight training to improve performance in the three competitive lifts—the squat, bench press and deadlift	The powerlifter is the athlete who practices the sport of lifting heavy weights in three different ways from a standing or lying position, but without lifting the weights above the head. Powerlifting is comprised of three lifts: the squat, the bench press and deadlift.	20
M9_41_5	Hypertrophic gain	hypertrophic gain is the increase in muscle volume due to an increase in the volume of its component elements (fibres, myofibrils, connective tissue, sarcomeres, contractile proteins, etc.)	Increase in muscle volume resulting from hypertrophy (muscle growth).	20
M9_41_6	Hypertrophic process	the hypertrophic process is the process that refers to muscular hypertrophy, a biological/physiological event that involves hypertrophy, i.e. an increase in the volume of the cells that make up a tissue, on the various types of muscle tissue. This can be referred to as skeletal muscle hypertrophy, cardiac muscle hypertrophy, or smooth muscle hypertrophy.	It is the process that occurs under conditions of muscle growth, i.e. an increase in the volume of body muscle tissue.	20
M9_41_6	Mechanical tension	mechanical tension is the combination of the internal forces of the muscle being contracted and the external forces caused by the weight being pulled or pushed	Mechanical tension is any force that tries to stretch our muscles.	20
M9_41_6	Metabolic stress	metabolic stress is a physiological process that occurs during exercise in response to low energy that leads to metabolite accumulation [lactate, phosphate inorganic (Pi) and ions of hydrogen (H+)] in muscle cells	Metabolic stress is a physiological process that facilitates muscle growth. Metabolic stress occurs when we increase the workload on a muscle or a specific muscle group. Several components are stimulated which together increase muscle mass, such as fibre recruitment, hormone production, or cellular hydration status.	20
M9_41_7	Muscle hypertrophy	muscle hypertrophy is a considerable increase in the size of muscles, caused by enlargement of its cellular components	Muscular hypertrophy refers to an increase in muscle mass. This usually manifests as an increase in muscle size and strength. Typically, muscle hypertrophy occurs as a result of strength training such as weight lifting.	20
